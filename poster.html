			<p>
			  Students pass thousands of posters for events a day. Flyers fight for studentâ€™s attention, often get covered up, are disposed of frequently, and use a huge amount of paper. By creating a hub for event posters, Poster App allows users to view and interact with nearby events creating a more involved and active community.
			</p>
			<p>
			  We created a prototype for a mobile-phone application that lets users scroll through events nearby, register for ones they are interested in, invite friends, and create their own profile. PosterApp is an application which connects clubs and organizations on college campuses with potential student participants.
